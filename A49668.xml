            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Board was Born in the Parish of <hi>Barn-Elms,</hi> of a very Antient Stock, and growing up in Years, was preferred to the Service of Sh. <hi>B—l</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Dresser-Board,</hi> in whose Kitchen he past his days in ease and quietness, free from the Burthen and Oppression of many Dishes, and such like Popish and Antichristian Ceremonies; but this happiness was too great to continue, for the Cheapness of Victuals soon invited his Master into the <hi>York-shire</hi> Climate, so that he was forthwith exposed to the Malice of a Popishly-Affected <hi>Cook-Maid,</hi> who boyling some <hi>Holy-Water</hi> for a <hi>Crop-sick Catholick,</hi> most inhumanely placed the red-hot Skillet upon him, which Barbarous Action could not but extort from him most hideous Groans and Howlings, all which notwithstanding, he firmly adhered to his first principles, and chose rather to be Martyr'd in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> than to dwell in a <hi>Popish Gluttonous Kitchen,</hi> tho' exposed to the Rage and Fury of <hi>Merry-Andrews, Jack-Puddings, red-hot Irons,</hi> and <hi>Toreys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reverend <hi>Scot,</hi> Dr. <hi>B—,</hi> so Remarkable for disturbing the Sick, no sooner heard of the Torments and bitter Agonies of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Board in the Lord, but he made hast to give him some crums of <hi>Christian Consolation,</hi> before he departed this Life, by which he might

            <p>The Board return'd the Dr. many Thanks for his Ghostly Advice, and desired him to sit down upon him. The Dr. being a profest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all manner of Ceremony, complyed, and sat him down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting with himself, That those who draw near their latter End, have commonly a foresight of future Events, proposed several <hi>Questions</hi> to him, concerning the deplorable condition of this Nation: <hi>First,</hi>
